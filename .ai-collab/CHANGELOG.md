## 2026-04-04 — [Claude Code] Arabic VS by City Page

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-04T14:00:00+04:00

### File Created

- **`src/app/(directory)/ar/pricing/vs/[comparison]/[city]/page.tsx`** — Arabic procedure-vs-procedure comparison page scoped to a specific UAE city. City-specific side-by-side comparison of two procedures, key differences table, cross-city comparison table, when-to-choose sections, insurance coverage block, 4 Arabic FAQs.

### Pattern applied

- `dir="rtl"` + `lang="ar"` on root wrapper div
- `border-r-4` RTL callout block
- `getArabicCityName()` for all city name display
- `toLocaleString("ar-AE")` for all numbers and percentages
- `regulatorAr()` inline helper (DHA/DOH/MOHAP in Arabic)
- `insuranceLabelAr()` inline helper for Arabic coverage labels
- hreflang en-AE/ar-AE alternates in metadata
- `generateStaticParams` matching English (all comparison×city pairs where both procedures have city pricing)
- `revalidate = 43200`, `dynamicParams = true`
- BreadcrumbList + FAQPage + SpeakableSpecification JSON-LD
- Zero ESLint warnings or errors

### Impact

- Completes all 13 Arabic pricing section pages requested. The other 12 (compare hub, compare/[cities], guide hub, guide/[guide], guide/[guide]/[city], journey hub, journey/[journey], journey/[journey]/[city], lists hub, lists/[listType]/[city], vs hub, vs/[comparison]) were already implemented in prior sessions.

## 2026-04-05 — [Claude Code] Breadcrumb href, OG siteName, and Table Border Fixes

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-05T05:00:00+04:00

### Files Changed
- **`src/app/(directory)/workforce/benchmarks/nurse-to-doctor/page.tsx`** — Added href="/workforce/benchmarks" to Benchmarks breadcrumb item + matching breadcrumbSchema URL.
- **`src/app/(directory)/workforce/benchmarks/staff-per-facility/page.tsx`** — Same breadcrumb fix.
- **`src/app/(directory)/workforce/benchmarks/specialist-per-capita/page.tsx`** — Same breadcrumb fix.
- **`src/app/(directory)/workforce/benchmarks/ftl-rate/page.tsx`** — Same breadcrumb fix.
- **`src/app/(directory)/workforce/career/[specialty]/page.tsx`** — Added href="/workforce/careers" to Careers breadcrumb item + matching breadcrumbSchema URL.
- **`src/app/(directory)/workforce/career/category/[category]/page.tsx`** — Same careers breadcrumb fix.
- **`src/app/(directory)/workforce/category/[category]/page.tsx`** — Changed siteName from "Zavis Healthcare Intelligence" to "UAE Open Healthcare Directory".
- **`src/app/(directory)/workforce/specialty/[specialty]/page.tsx`** — Same siteName fix.
- **`src/app/(directory)/workforce/overview/page.tsx`** — Changed 4 table thead `<tr>` borders from `border-b border-black/10` to `border-b-2 border-[#1c1c1c]` (design system standard).

### Why
- Breadcrumb intermediate items without href break navigation and reduce SEO value of BreadcrumbList schema.
- Inconsistent OG siteName hurts brand consistency in social media previews.
- Table header borders should match the design system standard (thick bottom border) used elsewhere on the page.

### Impact
- 9 files changed, zero lint errors.

## 2026-04-05 — [Claude Code] Accessibility and Design Consistency Fixes (WCAG, border-light-200, scope="col")

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-05T04:30:00+04:00

### Files Changed
- **`src/app/(directory)/workforce/overview/page.tsx`** — Changed text-black/40 to text-black/60 on FTL/REG explanation paragraph (WCAG AA contrast fix for body text). Added scope="col" to all th elements in thead (15 tables).
- **`src/app/globals.css`** — Replaced 3 border-light-200 occurrences with border-black/[0.06] in .article-row, .headline-item, .provider-card utility classes.
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/page.tsx`** — Replaced border-light-200 with border-black/[0.06], added scope="col" to th elements.
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/[category]/page.tsx`** — Same border and scope fixes.
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/[category]/[specialty]/page.tsx`** — Same border and scope fixes.
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/facility/[slug]/page.tsx`** — Same border and scope fixes.
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/stats/page.tsx`** — Added scope="col" to 16 th elements across 4 tables.
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/guide/[slug]/page.tsx`** — Replaced border-light-200 with border-black/[0.06] in 2 table rows.
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/area/[area]/page.tsx`** — Replaced border-light-200.
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/area/[area]/[specialty]/page.tsx`** — Replaced border-light-200.
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/[category]/[specialty]/consultants/page.tsx`** — Replaced border-light-200.
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/[category]/[specialty]/specialists/page.tsx`** — Replaced border-light-200.
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/facility/[slug]/[specialty]/page.tsx`** — Replaced border-light-200.
- **`src/app/(directory)/find-a-doctor/page.tsx`** — Replaced border-light-200.
- **18 Arabic pages** (ar/insurance/*, ar/labs/*, ar/directory/*, ar/page.tsx) — Replaced all border-light-200 with border-black/[0.06].

### Why
- border-light-200 was not a valid Tailwind utility despite light-200 being in the color config (Tailwind generates border-light-200 as a color but it renders as transparent in some build contexts). Replaced with explicit border-black/[0.06] for consistent rendering.
- WCAG AA requires 4.5:1 contrast for body text; text-black/40 (~2.83:1) fails this. Only changed on paragraph-length text, not intentional de-emphasized labels.
- scope="col" on th in thead is a WCAG accessibility requirement for screen readers to associate header cells with data columns.

### Impact
- 28 files changed, zero lint errors, zero new warnings. Purely visual/accessibility improvements -- no layout or functionality changes.

## 2026-04-05 — [Claude Code] Fix Broken Internal Links and Add BreadcrumbList JSON-LD

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-05T03:00:00+04:00

### Files Changed
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/compare/[slugs]/page.tsx`** — Fixed broken "best doctors" links: changed `/professionals/{cat}/{spec}/best` (404) to `/best/doctors/{spec}` (correct route).
- **`src/app/(directory)/workforce/benchmarks/page.tsx`** — Fixed 2 broken benchmark links: consultant-pipeline now points to `/workforce/specialties`, specialty-concentration now points to `/workforce/areas`. Both are existing hub pages.
- **`src/app/(directory)/workforce/careers/page.tsx`** — Fixed career guide links: changed base path from `/workforce/guide/` (404) to `/professionals/guide/` (existing route). Remapped 6 guide slugs to match 6 existing guide pages (dha-licensing, specialist-vs-consultant, ftl-vs-reg, international-doctors-dubai, choosing-right-specialist, healthcare-workforce).
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/[category]/page.tsx`** — Added `breadcrumbSchema` import and `<JsonLd data={breadcrumbSchema([...])} />` for BreadcrumbList structured data.
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/[category]/[specialty]/page.tsx`** — Added BreadcrumbList JSON-LD with 5-level breadcrumb (UAE > Directory > Professionals > Category > Specialty).
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/[category]/[specialty]/specialists/page.tsx`** — Added BreadcrumbList JSON-LD with 6-level breadcrumb (UAE > Directory > Professionals > Category > Specialty > Specialists).
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/[category]/[specialty]/consultants/page.tsx`** — Added BreadcrumbList JSON-LD with 6-level breadcrumb (UAE > Directory > Professionals > Category > Specialty > Consultants).
- **`src/app/(directory)/find-a-doctor/page.tsx`** — Added `breadcrumbSchema` to existing seo import and BreadcrumbList JSON-LD with 3-level breadcrumb (UAE > Directory > Find a Doctor).

### Why
Broken internal links create dead ends for users and waste crawl budget. Missing BreadcrumbList JSON-LD means Google cannot display breadcrumb rich results for these pages.

### Impact
- 3 pages with broken links fixed (compare, benchmarks hub, careers hub)
- 5 pages now emit BreadcrumbList structured data for Google rich results
- Zero lint errors

## 2026-04-04 — [Claude Code] Fix 4 Critical Issues in Professional Directory

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-04T22:00:00+04:00

### Files Changed
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/[category]/[specialty]/page.tsx`** — Added displayLimit=200 to prevent rendering 28K+ rows. Sort applied to sliced array. Added "Showing X of Y" subtitle text and overflow note after table.
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/facility/[slug]/page.tsx`** — Fixed soft 404: replaced custom "not found" HTML (HTTP 200) with `notFound()` from `next/navigation` for proper 404 response.
- **`src/app/(directory)/professionals/stats/page.tsx`** — Removed local `DUBAI_POPULATION = 3_600_000` constant; now imports from `@/lib/workforce` which has the correct value of 3,660,000. Fixed hardcoded "3.6 million" FAQ text to use dynamic value.
- **`src/lib/professionals.ts`** — Wrapped `JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(...))` in try/catch so build doesn't crash with unhelpful error if data file is missing; logs clear error message and returns empty dataset gracefully.

### Impact
- Specialty pages with large datasets (e.g., registered-nurse) no longer attempt to render 28K+ table rows
- Facility pages with invalid slugs now return proper HTTP 404 (SEO soft 404 fix)
- Population-based calculations are consistent across all pages (3.66M, not 3.6M)
- Build resilience improved: missing data file produces clear error instead of crash

- **`src/app/(directory)/best/[city]/[category]/page.tsx`** — Three major additions:
  - **Unique editorial intro**: `getCategoryIntro()` function generates category-specific headlines + body text for 10 categories (hospitals, clinics, dental, dermatology, ophthalmology, cardiology, mental-health, pediatrics, fertility-ivf, cosmetic-plastic) with intelligent fallback for others
  - **Selection criteria section**: "How We Rank" — 3-column card grid explaining ranking methodology (patient ratings, years of practice, insurance coverage)
  - **Comparison table**: Side-by-side HTML table for top 10 providers with columns: Rank, Provider, Rating, Reviews, Established, Insurance Plans, Verified, Area

### 2. FAQ Expansion for AI Overviews
- **`src/app/(directory)/best/[city]/[category]/page.tsx`** — Added 7 long-tail conversational FAQs targeting AI Overview queries:
  - Cost without insurance, specific insurer acceptance, required documents, provider locations by neighborhood, online booking availability, multilingual staff, Friday/holiday hours, license verification
  - All data-driven using computed stats (topLanguages, topNeighborhoodNames, verifiedCount, providersWithWebsite, providersWithPhone)

### 3. Topical Authority Clusters (hub-and-spoke cross-linking)
- **`src/lib/intelligence/data.ts`** — NEW: `getArticlesByDirectoryContext(cityName, categorySlug, categoryName, limit)` — scores articles by tag overlap with city name + category keywords + recency for cross-linking
- **`src/app/(directory)/directory/[city]/[...segments]/page.tsx`** — Added "Related Intelligence" section on city+category pages (between FAQ and "Other specialties"). Shows up to 4 relevant intelligence articles with category badge, date, title, and excerpt. Imports `loadDbArticles`, `getArticlesByDirectoryContext`, `getJournalCategory`, `formatDate`.
- **`src/app/(directory)/intelligence/[slug]/page.tsx`** — Replaced static "Browse the Directory" sidebar with dynamic "Related Providers" section. Matches article tags against `CITIES` and `CATEGORIES` constants, queries top-rated providers for matched city+category, shows up to 4 providers with name, address, rating badge, and "Browse all" CTA. Falls back to static directory links if no match found. Imports `getProviders`, `CITIES`, `CATEGORIES`.

### 4. llms.txt — AI Search Optimization
- **`public/llms.txt`** — Enhanced with prioritized page URLs (directory cities, best-of rankings, intelligence categories), structured for AI crawlers. Added reference to llms-full.txt.
- **`public/llms-full.txt`** — NEW: Comprehensive deep-indexing file with full city descriptions, all 28 healthcare categories with subcategories and example URLs, ranking methodology, insurance coverage info, regulatory bodies, all 9 intelligence verticals, FAQs, and citation format.

### 5. AggregateRating Schema & IndexNow
- **No changes needed** — both already implemented:
  - `AggregateRating` in `medicalOrganizationSchema()` at `src/lib/seo.ts:55-65`
  - `notifyIndexNow()` in `src/lib/intelligence/automation/pipeline.ts:89-111`

### 6. Service-Specific Landing Pages (`/directory/{city}/{procedure}`)
- **`src/lib/directory-utils.ts`** — Extended `resolveSegments()` to recognize procedure slugs as `city-service` route type. When a single segment doesn't match a category or area, checks against `PROCEDURES` constant via dynamic import.
- **`src/app/(directory)/directory/[city]/[...segments]/page.tsx`** — Two additions:
  - **Metadata case**: `city-service` case in `generateMetadata()` switch — generates SEO title/description with provider count and pricing data
  - **Page rendering**: Full service landing page with: answer block, quick info cards (duration, recovery, insurance, cost), provider grid (top 9 by rating), UAE city price comparison table, "What to Expect" section, insurance coverage, related procedures, same-category procedures, cross-links to pricing/category/best-of pages, 6 FAQs, disclaimer
  - Imports: `PROCEDURES`, `getProcedureBySlug`, `formatAed`, `MedicalProcedure`, `CITIES`, `Activity`, `ArrowRight`
- **~328 new flat URLs** (41 procedures × 8 cities) — all via ISR (no pre-rendering)
- **Examples**: `/directory/dubai/teeth-whitening`, `/directory/abu-dhabi/knee-replacement`, `/directory/sharjah/mri-scan`

**Impact:** 6 SEO/AEO features shipped. ~328 new service landing pages. Hub-and-spoke cross-linking between directory and intelligence. Enhanced AI crawler discoverability. All lint-clean, zero errors.

## 2026-04-02 — [Claude Code] CQ2/CQ3 follow-up: Eliminate remaining type casts in automation dashboard

**Signed by:** Claude Code -- 2026-04-02T22:30:00+04:00

- **`src/types/dashboard.ts`** -- Added `PerformanceInsightRecommendations`, `ContentPatterns`, `TimingScores` interfaces. Updated `PerformanceInsight` to use these specific types instead of `Record<string, unknown>` for `recommendations`, `content_patterns`, and `timing_scores`.
- **`src/app/(directory)/dashboard/automation/page.tsx`** -- Replaced 5 local interface definitions (Schedule, AutomationRun, QueueItem, Notification, PerformanceInsight) with imports from `@/types/dashboard`. Changed `latestReport` state from `Record<string, unknown>` to `AutomationLatestReport`. Changed `latestScore` state from `Record<string, unknown>` to `AutomationLatestScore`. Eliminated all 8 `as Record<string, ...>` type casts. Added null-safe date rendering for `published_at`.
- **Impact:** Zero `any` types, zero `as Record` casts, zero `eslint-disable` comments remain across all 9 dashboard files.

## 2026-04-02 — [Claude Code] CQ2/CQ3: Eliminate `any` types and `eslint-disable` from dashboard

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-02T21:00:00+04:00

- **`src/types/dashboard.ts`** — NEW: 20 TypeScript interfaces covering all dashboard data structures: PipelineRunSummary, PipelineRunDetail, PipelineComment, LinkedInPost, EmailBlast, PerformanceScore, AnalyticsRun, AutomationSchedule, AutomationRun, AutomationStageLogEntry, PostQueueItem, AutomationNotification, PerformanceInsight, HeadlineStat, PipelineRunSynthesis, PipelineRunDetailResponse, AutomationLatestReport, AutomationLatestScore. Derived from SQL schema in scripts/db/run-schema.mjs and scripts/automation/migrate.mjs.
- **`src/app/(directory)/dashboard/pipeline/[id]/page.tsx`** — Removed eslint-disable comment. Replaced 5 `any` useState types with proper interfaces (PipelineRunDetail, LinkedInPost[], EmailBlast[], PerformanceScore). Replaced 4 `catch (err: any)` with `catch (err: unknown)` + `instanceof Error` guard. Replaced `(s: any)` in synthesis headline_stats map with HeadlineStat. Removed unused `Link` import. Wrapped fetchData in useCallback to fix react-hooks/exhaustive-deps warning.
- **`src/app/(directory)/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx`** — Removed eslint-disable comment. Replaced `any[]` state with `AnalyticsRun[]`. Typed `.map(async (run: any) =>` as `PipelineRunSummary`. Typed API response shapes. Removed unused `Link` import. Fixed `.catch(err =>` to use instanceof Error.
- **`src/app/(directory)/dashboard/emails/page.tsx`** — Removed eslint-disable comment. Replaced `any[]` with `EmailBlast[]`. Removed unused `Link` import.
- **`src/app/(directory)/dashboard/posts/page.tsx`** — Removed eslint-disable comment. Replaced `any[]` with `LinkedInPost[]`. Wrapped fetchPosts in useCallback to fix react-hooks/exhaustive-deps warning.
- **`src/app/(directory)/dashboard/calendar/page.tsx`** — Removed eslint-disable comment. Removed unused `TYPE_LABELS` constant that was triggering no-unused-vars.

**Impact:** Zero `any` types and zero `eslint-disable` comments remain in any dashboard component. Full `npm run lint` passes cleanly.

## 2026-04-02 — [Claude Code] Audit wave 4: LRU cache, column whitelist, batch inserts, composite index, sitemap lastmod

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-02T16:00:00+04:00

- **`src/lib/data.ts`** — P6: Replaced unbounded Map cache with bounded LRU (max 500 entries). On cache hit, entry is moved to end (most-recently-used). On set, oldest entry evicted when over limit. Same TTL (5 min), same interface.
- **`src/app/api/research/posts/route.ts`** — D6: GET handler SELECT * replaced with explicit column list (id, run_id, account, content, first_comment, hashtags, status, scheduled_for, posted_at, created_at, updated_at).
- **`src/app/api/research/emails/route.ts`** — D6: GET handler SELECT * replaced with explicit column list excluding body_html and body_text (large fields unnecessary for list queries).
- **`src/lib/db/seed.ts`** — D7: Converted all 6 seed functions from sequential single-row inserts to batch inserts (cities, areas, categories, subcategories, providers, faqs). Each now builds a values array and does a single INSERT.
- **`src/lib/db/schema.ts`** — D8: Added composite index `idx_providers_city_status` on `(cityId, status)` for common filter combination. D9: Added comment explaining why faqs.entityId has no FK (polymorphic — references cities, categories, or providers based on entityType).
- **`src/app/sitemap.ts`** — S9: Replaced all `new Date()` lastModified values with fixed `LAST_CONTENT_UPDATE = new Date('2026-04-02')`. Added comment explaining the rationale and when to update.
- **Impact:** 6 audit items resolved across 6 files. Zero lint errors.

## 2026-04-03 — [Claude Code] SEC11: XSS sanitization for dangerouslySetInnerHTML

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-03T03:00:00+04:00

- **Installed `isomorphic-dompurify`** (+ `@types/dompurify` dev dep) — works in both server components (Node/JSDOM) and client components (browser DOM).
- **Created `src/lib/sanitize.ts`** — exports `sanitizeHtml(html: string): string` using DOMPurify with `ADD_TAGS: ["iframe"]` and social embed data attributes whitelisted.
- **`src/components/intelligence/SocialEmbed.tsx`** — the primary XSS risk (AI-generated article bodies rendered via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`). Now sanitizes HTML after embed processing, before rendering.
- **`src/app/(directory)/directory/guide/[slug]/page.tsx`** — defense-in-depth sanitization on guide article paragraph HTML. Content is currently static seed data but the pattern is now safe if the source changes.
- **NOT modified (trusted internal sources):** `JsonLd.tsx` (JSON.stringify of structured data), `ar/layout.tsx` (hardcoded inline script for lang/dir).
- **Impact:** Closes SEC11. All AI/external HTML content is now sanitized before DOM injection. Zero lint errors.

## 2026-04-03 — [Claude Code] Audit Wave 3: SEC13 + SEC15 + CQ8

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-03T02:00:00+04:00

- **SEC13: Remove localhost auth bypass** — `src/middleware.ts`: removed `isLocal` check that skipped dashboard auth for `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`. Auth now enforced on all hosts.
- **SEC15: Hardcoded integration IDs → env vars** — `scripts/automation/lib/config.mjs`: Postiz integration IDs now read from `POSTIZ_HIDAYAT_LINKEDIN_ID` and `POSTIZ_ZAVIS_FACEBOOK_ID` env vars with current values as fallbacks.
- **CQ8: Document pipeline thresholds** — `src/lib/intelligence/automation/pipeline.ts`: added detailed comments explaining the `MINIMUM_SCORE = 35` threshold (scoring criteria, why 35, impact of changing) and the `slice(0, 3)` batch limit (serverless timeout constraint, per-article cost, alternative for bulk).

## 2026-04-03 — [Claude Code] Audit Wave 2: Security hardening + GSAP code-splitting

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-03T01:00:00+04:00

- **P2: GSAP code-splitting** — Converted all 6 GSAP-importing files (`AnimatedSection.tsx`, `LenisProvider.tsx`, `ChannelIconGrid.tsx`, `IntegrationHub.tsx`, `OrbitalDisplay.tsx`, `HomePageClient.tsx`) from static `import gsap` to dynamic `import("gsap")` inside `useEffect`. GSAP (~350KB) and Lenis now lazy-loaded, excluded from initial bundle.
- **SEC3: Weak password removed** — Removed `'zavis_research_2026'` fallback from `auth.ts`, `middleware.ts` (2 occurrences), and `auth/route.ts`. Dashboard now requires `DASHBOARD_KEY` env var or rejects all auth.
- **SEC6: CSP header** — Added `Content-Security-Policy` to `next.config.mjs` with proper `script-src` for GTM/FB/LinkedIn, `style-src` for Google Fonts, `frame-src` for YouTube, `object-src: none`, `base-uri: self`.
- **SEC10: Input validation** — Added type checks, length limits, and array bounds to `posts/route.ts` (content 10K, account 100, firstComment 5K, hashtags 30) and `emails/route.ts` (subject 500, bodyHtml 200K, segment whitelist).
- **SEC12: Error leak** — Removed `details` field from `sheets/route.ts` error response. Internal errors only logged server-side.
- **P11: Graceful DB shutdown** — Added `process.once('SIGTERM'/'SIGINT', () => pool.end())` to both `db/index.ts` and `research/db.ts`.
- **Impact:** 6 audit items resolved. Zero lint errors.

## 2026-04-03 — [Claude Code] Memoize computed arrays in HomePageClient

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-03T01:00:00+04:00

- **`src/components/landing/pages/HomePageClient.tsx`** — Added `useMemo` import. Extracted inline `clientLogos` array (12 duplicated logo objects for marquee) and `integrationLogos` array (channel + EMR partner slice) into `useMemo` hooks with `[]` deps (both are static). Replaced inline JSX array creation with memoized references.
- **`src/components/research/research-page-client.tsx`** — Already had `useMemo` wrapping the `Array.from(new Set(...))` categories computation. No changes needed.
- **Why:** Audit found unmemoized array allocations on every render in client components.
- **Impact:** HomePageClient no longer creates 2 new arrays + 12 new objects on every render cycle. Zero lint errors.

## 2026-04-03 — [Claude Code] Fix silent error swallowing in dashboard components

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-03T00:15:00+04:00

- **`src/app/(directory)/dashboard/pipeline/[id]/page.tsx`** — Added error state rendering: when `error` is set, the page now shows a red error message with a Retry button instead of silently failing. The file already had proper `.catch()` and `.finally()` on its fetch chain, but never rendered the error to the user.
- **`src/app/(directory)/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx`** — Added `const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)`. Added `if (!r.ok) throw new Error(...)` response checks and `.catch(err => setError(err.message || 'Something went wrong'))` to both useEffect fetch chains (completed runs and published runs). Added error paragraph rendering above the table. The second useEffect previously had no `.catch()` at all.
- **Why:** Audit found silent error swallowing — fetch failures produced no user-visible feedback. The analytics page had no error state, no `.catch()` on the published-runs effect, and no response status checks. The pipeline detail page caught errors but never displayed them.
- **Impact:** Both dashboard pages now surface fetch errors to the user instead of silently failing with empty/stale data.

## 2026-04-02 — [Claude Code] SEO: Add missing openGraph.images to dynamic listing pages

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-02T23:45:00+04:00

- **`src/app/(directory)/directory/[city]/[...segments]/page.tsx`** — Added `openGraph` with `images` to `city-area`, `area-category`, `area-insurance` (images were missing), and `city-category-subcategory` metadata cases. Category-related pages use the category image; area-only and insurance pages use `clinics.webp` as generic fallback.
- **`src/app/(directory)/ar/directory/[city]/[...segments]/page.tsx`** — Added `getCategoryImageUrl` helper function and `openGraph` with `images` to all 4 metadata cases (`city-category`, `city-area`, `area-category`, `listing`). Uses `locale: 'ar_AE'` and Arabic `siteName`.
- **Why:** SEO audit found that these dynamic provider listing pages had no `openGraph.images`, meaning social shares and search previews showed no image. The English `city-category` and `listing` cases already had OG images; the rest were missing.
- **Impact:** All dynamic directory pages now emit proper OG images for social sharing and rich search previews.

## 2026-04-02 — [Claude Code] Research Pages: force-dynamic → ISR (1 hour)

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-02T23:30:00+04:00

- **`src/app/(research)/research/page.tsx`** — Replaced `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` with `export const revalidate = 3600`
- **`src/app/(research)/research/[slug]/page.tsx`** — Same change
- **Why:** Both pages only call `getAllPublishedReports()` / `getReportBySlug()` which read from the filesystem via `fs.readFileSync` / `fs.readdirSync`. No cookies, headers, or search params are accessed. `force-dynamic` forced every request to re-render server-side, adding unnecessary latency and compute. ISR with 1-hour revalidation caches the rendered page and revalidates in the background.
- **Impact:** Faster TTFB on all 9 research URLs (index + 8 report pages). New reports published to `data/reports/` will appear within 1 hour, or immediately via `/api/revalidate`.

## 2026-04-02 — [Claude Code] Comprehensive Optimization Audit + Critical Fixes

**Signed by:** Claude Code · 2026-04-02T22:00:00+04:00

### SEO Fixes
- **Soft 404 resolution:** Area+category pages with 0 providers now call `notFound()` instead of rendering "No providers found" (EN + AR). `/healthcare` route now returns proper 404 via server-side check.
- **FAQ operating hours fix:** Empty `operatingHours` objects no longer render broken "Provider Name: . Verified [ISO timestamp]". Now shows "Contact provider for hours."
- **Raw ISO timestamps → human dates:** All `lastVerified` renders across EN/AR listing pages now show "25 March 2026" / "٢٥ مارس ٢٠٢٦" instead of `2026-03-25T14:14:41.336Z`

### Performance (LCP)
- **Specialty page LCP fix:** Hero image removed from `AnimatedSection delay={0.4}` wrapper (was setting `opacity:0` via GSAP, blocking LCP for 400ms+). Switched from `<img>` to `next/image` with `priority` prop. Affects 88 URLs (`/dermatology`, `/optometry`, etc.)
- **BrandIcons:** Added `loading="lazy"` to all 16 `<img>` tags

### Infrastructure
- **Vercel cleanup:** Removed `vercel.json`, uninstalled `@vercel/analytics`, `@vercel/blob`, `@vercel/speed-insights`. Updated hardcoded Vercel URL fallback in ContactPageClient. Updated ingest route comments to reference EC2.
- **DB pool:** `max: 2` → `max: 10, min: 2, idleTimeoutMillis: 30000` in both `src/lib/db/index.ts` and `src/lib/research/db.ts`

### Security
- **Hardcoded API key removed:** `scripts/media/generate-cover.mjs` no longer falls back to a hardcoded Gemini key
- **Health endpoint:** Removed git commit message, author from `/api/health` response (info disclosure)
- **Revalidate endpoint:** Added path traversal validation (`startsWith("/")`, no `..`)

### Schema
- **Missing indexes added:** `isVerified`, `isClaimed`, `isFeatured` on providers table
- **CASCADE delete:** Added `onDelete: "cascade"` to `claimRequests.providerId`

### Accessibility
- **SearchBar:** Added `aria-label` and `role="search"` to compact form

**Files changed:** `[...segments]/page.tsx` (EN+AR), `[specialty]/page.tsx`, `SpecialtyPageClient.tsx`, `BrandIcons.tsx`, `SearchBar.tsx`, `db/index.ts`, `research/db.ts`, `db/schema.ts`, `research/auth.ts`, `api/health/route.ts`, `api/revalidate/route.ts`, `api/intelligence/ingest/route.ts`, `ContactPageClient.tsx`, `generate-cover.mjs`, `vercel.json` (deleted), `package.json`

- **Design templates doc:** Created `docs/design-templates.md` cataloging all 20 template archetypes with exact classes
- **Deploy fix:** Reverted `NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-new` build approach that caused `_document` module error — back to proven backup/build/rollback pattern
- **Zero type errors, zero lint errors**
- **All 20 page templates verified returning 200 on localhost**

- **generateStaticParams:** `TEST_CATEGORIES.map(cat => ({ category: cat.slug }))`
- **Breadcrumbs:** Home → مقارنة أسعار الفحوصات المخبرية → فحوصات {cat.name}; breadcrumb home link points to `/ar`
- **Other categories grid:** links to `/ar/labs/category/[slug]` (Arabic); count label uses "فحص في هذه الفئة"
- **Language switch:** Footer link to English `/labs/category/[cat.slug]`
- **No unused imports**, `dir="rtl" lang="ar"` on root div
- **Impact:** Arabic-speaking users searching for specific test categories in UAE now have a properly localized, indexable page with full MSA copy

## 2026-03-28 — [Claude Code] Arabic Insurance Guide Hub Page Created

- **New file:** `src/app/(directory)/ar/insurance/guide/page.tsx`
- **What:** Arabic-language hub page listing all 5 insurance guides at `/ar/insurance/guide` — full MSA translation of guide titles, descriptions, heading, and intro paragraph
- **Guide slugs kept as-is** (URL paths, not translated)
- **DHA, DOH, MOHAP** kept as abbreviations per project rules
- **Links:** Each guide card points to `/ar/insurance/guide/[slug]` (Arabic versions)
- **SEO:** `generateMetadata` sets canonical to `${base}/ar/insurance/guide`, hreflang alternates to `/insurance/guide` (en-AE) and `/ar/insurance/guide` (ar-AE)
- **ISR:** `revalidate = 43200` (12 hours)
- **JSON-LD:** breadcrumbSchema and speakableSchema applied
- **No unused imports**, zero lint errors expected
- **Impact:** Arabic-speaking users searching for UAE health insurance guides now land on a properly localized hub page

## 2026-03-28 — [Claude Code] Arabic Labs Page Created

- **New file:** `src/app/(directory)/ar/labs/page.tsx`
- **What:** Arabic-language mirror of `/labs` at `/ar/labs` — full MSA translation of all headings, stats labels, answer-block paragraphs, 6 FAQ answers, and disclaimer
- **Rules followed:** Lab names (Al Borg, Thumbay, Medsol, DarDoc), test names (CBC, Vitamin D, HbA1c), AED prices, and accreditation names (DHA, DOH, MOHAP, CAP, ISO) kept in English
- **SEO:** `generateMetadata` sets canonical to `${base}/ar/labs` with hreflang alternates pointing to `/labs` (en-AE) and `/ar/labs` (ar-AE)
- **ISR:** `revalidate = 43200` (12 hours, matching English page)
- **Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` and `eslint` both pass with zero errors
- **Impact:** Arabic-speaking users and Arabic-language search queries now have a proper localized landing page for UAE lab test price comparison

## 2026-03-27 — [Claude Code] Canonical Domain Fix: www.zavis.ai → zavis.ai

- **`getBaseUrl()`** now always returns `https://zavis.ai` (strips www even if env var has it)
- **Middleware redirect** flipped: `www.zavis.ai` → `zavis.ai` (was the opposite)
- **Why:** GSC property is `zavis.ai` (no www), but sitemap/robots.txt/canonicals all pointed to `www.zavis.ai`. Google couldn't fetch the sitemap because of the domain mismatch.
- **Impact:** All sitemaps, canonical URLs, OG URLs, JSON-LD schema now use `zavis.ai`. Google will re-index with non-www URLs (301 redirect ensures no broken links).
- **Note:** Nginx on EC2 may still have a non-www→www redirect that should be flipped to match. The middleware handles it at the Next.js layer so the site works correctly regardless.

## 2026-03-27 — [Claude Code] Deploy Branch Switch: main → live

- **Deploy workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) now triggers on push to `live` instead of `main`
- **Journal pipeline** (`.github/workflows/journal-full-pipeline.yml`) now pulls/pushes `live` instead of `main`
- **Default branch** on GitHub changed to `live`
- **EC2 server** will pull from `live` on deploy — this also deploys the debloat commit (`5ceb406`) which was previously only on `live` but not `main`
- Updated all documentation: CLAUDE.md, .ai-collab/DEPLOYMENT.md, .ai-collab/STATUS.md, .ai-context.md
- **Why:** The `live` branch had the latest work (including the sitemap rewrite and 61% debloat) but the deploy workflow was still pointing at `main`. This caused the sitemap to 404 on production since the old dynamic sitemap on `main` was timing out.

## 2026-03-26 — [Claude Code] Major Cleanup, Remotion Extraction & SEO Hardening

### Junk Cleanup
- Renamed package from `uae-health-directory` to `zavis-landing` in package.json
- Removed `@neondatabase/serverless` from dependencies (zero neon imports remain)
- Deleted `.env.prod-check`, `.env.vercel-check`, `.env.vercel` (leaked Neon credentials)
- Removed mollymillions-code and girish remote references from DEPLOYMENT.md
- Deleted `.vercel/` directory (no longer on Vercel)
- Fixed hardcoded Neon URL in `scripts/run-schema.mjs` → uses `process.env.DATABASE_URL`
- Updated `.env.local.example` with local PostgreSQL connection string

### Remotion Extraction
- Moved `remotion/` directory to standalone project at `/zavis-remotion/`
- Moved `scripts/render-slide-video.mjs` and `scripts/generate-voiceover.mjs` to zavis-remotion
- Removed devDependencies: `remotion`, `@remotion/bundler`, `@remotion/cli`, `@remotion/renderer`
- Removed npm scripts: `video:studio`, `video:render`, `video:voiceover`
- Cleaned `tsconfig.json` excludes
- Net reduction: ~1700 lines removed from codebase

### SEO Hardening
- **Security headers:** Added HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy to `next.config.mjs` + Nginx
- **poweredByHeader: false** — no more X-Powered-By leak
- **Tracking scripts optimized:** Converted 7 inline scripts to Next.js `<Script>` — GTM/GAds use `afterInteractive`, Twitter/Clarity/LinkedIn/Meta/Reb2b use `lazyOnload` (faster LCP/INP)
- **www canonicalization:** `zavis.ai` → `www.zavis.ai` 301 redirect in middleware.ts + Nginx
- **llms.txt:** Created `public/llms.txt` for AI search visibility (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.)
- **robots.ts:** Added rules to block training crawlers (CCBot, cohere-ai)
- **Sitemap rewrite:** Replaced single dynamic sitemap with chunked index (10 chunks via `generateSitemaps()`). Each chunk serves ~3000-5000 URLs. ISR with 1-hour revalidation. Google now gets `/sitemap.xml` → `/sitemap/0.xml` through `/sitemap/9.xml`.

## 2026-03-26 — [Claude Code] DB Audit & Stability Fixes

- Fixed recurring `zavis_admin` PostgreSQL password authentication failure — password was being reset by other EC2 services
- Applied Drizzle migration `0001_round_gabe_jones.sql` — added `city_slug`, `category_slug`, `area_slug`, `subcategory_slug`, `facility_type`, `description_ar`, `review_summary`, `review_summary_ar`, `google_photo_url` columns + 4 indexes to `providers` table
- Populated slug columns for all 12,504 providers from FK relationships (cities, categories, areas, subcategories)
- Re-granted all table permissions to `zavis_admin` after schema changes
- Verified: 12,504 providers, 108 journal articles, 8 cities, 28 categories, 62 areas, 53 subcategories, 88 FAQs — all intact
- Updated .ai-collab STATUS.md, CHANGELOG.md, .ai-context.md, and CLAUDE.md with comprehensive deployment rules and data layer documentation

## 2026-03-25 — [Claude Code] Data Layer Migration (JSON → PostgreSQL)

- Migrated `src/lib/data.ts` from synchronous JSON reads (58MB `providers-scraped.json`) to async PostgreSQL queries via Drizzle ORM
- ALL data functions are now ASYNC — `getProviders()`, `getCityBySlug()`, `getProviderBySlug()`, `getAreaBySlug()`, etc.
- Every page component that calls these functions was updated to `await` them
- Seeded 12,504 providers to DB via `scripts/seed-providers-to-db.ts`
- Sitemap changed to `force-dynamic` to prevent build timeout with 32k+ URLs
- Fallback: if DB is empty, auto-detects and falls back to JSON (commit `ee5de07`)

## 2026-03-25 — [Claude Code] Safe Deploy with Rollback

- Rewrote `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with safe deploy pipeline:
  1. Backup current `.next` before pulling new code
  2. If build fails → restore backup `.next` → PM2 restart → site stays up on previous version
  3. If health check fails after restart → rollback to backup
- This prevents the site-down scenario where a broken build wipes `.next` and PM2 crash-loops

## 2026-03-25 — [Claude Code] New Page Types (SEO/AEO Expansion)

- 34 healthcare comparison pages (city vs city, hospitals vs clinics)
- Procedure cost pages with provider cards and price tables
- 37 government healthcare filter pages (city, category, area levels)
- Area-level walk-in clinic pages with wait times and FAQs
- Area-level 24-hour and emergency directory pages
- Conditions guide pages with city variants
- Area-level insurance pages
- Lab test result interpretation pages (15 tests: CBC, Vitamin D, B12, etc.)

## 2026-03-25 — [Claude Code] 24-Hour Provider Pages + Area-Level Insurance Pages

- **New file:** `src/app/(directory)/directory/[city]/24-hours/page.tsx` — 24-hour provider filtered pages for all 8 cities
- **Modified:** `src/app/(directory)/directory/[city]/[...segments]/page.tsx` — Added `area-insurance` resolved type for `/directory/[city]/[area]/insurance`
- **Modified:** `src/app/sitemap.ts` — Added 24-hours URLs for all 8 cities + area-insurance URLs for all areas with providers
- **Why:** SEO capture for "24 hour clinic Dubai", "open now pharmacy Abu Dhabi", "insurance JLT Dubai" queries
- **Impact:** 8 new 24-hours city pages + ~62 area-insurance pages, all with JSON-LD, FAQs, answer blocks, cross-links

## 2026-03-25 — [Claude Code] Insurer vs Insurer Head-to-Head Comparison Pages

- **New file:** `src/app/(directory)/insurance/compare/[matchup]/page.tsx` — Programmatic comparison pages for top insurer matchups
- **Modified:** `src/app/sitemap.ts` — Added ~45 matchup URLs for top 10 insurers by network size
- **Why:** SEO/AEO play — captures "Daman vs AXA" and similar comparison search queries with rich structured data
- **Impact:** ~45 new statically generated pages with JSON-LD, dynamic FAQs, side-by-side tables, network bar charts, plan cards, and verdict blocks

## 2026-03-25 — [Claude Code] Description Enrichment Fix (1763-2440)

- Rewrote 500 provider descriptions at indices 1763-2440 where description contained boilerplate "Licensed and regulated by" text
- All 500 entries: 80-105 words (avg 86), 100% in 80-120 word range
- All providers are Dubai-based (DHA regulated)
- 30+ facility types handled: polyclinics (160), optical centers (72), community pharmacies (68), school clinics (47), home healthcare (25), clinical support centers, day surgery, beauty centers, hospitals, laboratories, fertility centers, TCAM clinics, dental labs, cord blood centers, and more
- Name-based specialty detection for correct service descriptions (dental, derma, gynae, nutrition, physio, Ayurveda, autism, Down syndrome, early intervention, chiropractic, osteopathy, prosthetics, etc.)
- FT health desk voice throughout — no AI-tells, no banned words, no promotional tone
- Output: `scripts/enrichment-chunks/fix2-1763-2440.json` — 500 entries, format: `{"index": {"description": "..."}}`

## 2026-03-25 — [Claude Code] Description Enrichment Fix (6000-9999)

- Wrote 4000 new provider descriptions for ALL indices 6000-9999 (all had "licensed and regulated by" pattern from prior enrichment run)
- Also resolved 11 git merge conflicts in `src/lib/providers-scraped.json` (took HEAD version for all)
- Each description: 80-112 words (avg 89), no banned phrases, warm and professional tone
- Includes: facility name + type (inferred from facilityType + name + services) + area/city, type-specific service sentences (pharmacy/warehouse/optical/dental/school/nursery/first aid/ayurvedic/general), patient rating + review count, language accessibility, correct regulator (DHA/DOH/MOHAP by city), phone contact
- 3-way sentence variation (idx % 3) to avoid duplicate phrasing across entries
- Output: `scripts/enrichment-chunks/fix-6000-9999.json` — 4000 entries, format: `{"index": {"description": "..."}}`

## 2026-03-25 — [Claude Code] Description Enrichment Fix (3000-5999)

- Wrote 615 new provider descriptions for indices 5000-5998 (all providers in 3000-5999 range where description contained "Licensed by" or was under 50 words — all 615 were in 5000-5998)
- Each description: 80-101 words (avg 94.8), unique per facility type, warm tone, no banned phrases
- Includes: facility name + type + area/city, type-specific services, correct regulator (DHA/DOH/MOHAP by city), patient rating + review count, phone contact
- Fixed 112 article grammar errors (a optical/eye -> an optical/eye), 10 plural errors (1 reviews -> 1 review)
- Output: `scripts/enrichment-chunks/fix-3000-5999.json` — 431KB, 615 entries, format: `{"index": {"description": "..."}}`

## 2026-03-25

### CI/CD: Lint gate added to deploy pipeline
- Deploy workflow now runs `npm run lint` + `tsc --noEmit` BEFORE deploying to EC2
- If lint fails, deploy is blocked — broken code never reaches production
- This was added after unused imports in the labs feature crashed the site (PM2 crash-looped 1405 times, 502 Bad Gateway)
- Fixed unused imports in `labs/home-collection/[city]/page.tsx` and `[city]/[category]/page.tsx`

### Full Neon-to-pg Migration (all scripts)
- Migrated ALL remaining 14 scripts from `@neondatabase/serverless` to `pg` (node-postgres)
- Zero `@neondatabase/serverless` imports remain in the entire codebase
- `scripts/automation/lib/db.mjs` (shared DB module) now uses `pg.Pool` with tagged template wrapper
- `src/lib/intelligence/automation/pipeline.ts` now uses direct `pg.Pool.query()`
- `journal-full-pipeline.yml` workflow now runs on EC2 via SSH (not GitHub runner) since DB is localhost-only

### Tracking & Analytics
- Added Reb2b visitor identification script (`GOYPYHQZ9POX`) to root layout alongside existing GTM, Google Ads, Twitter, Clarity, LinkedIn, and Meta pixels

### Migration from Vercel to Self-Hosted EC2
- Switched DB driver from `@neondatabase/serverless` (neon-http) to `pg` (node-postgres) in 3 files:
  - `src/lib/db/index.ts` — Main Drizzle ORM connection
  - `src/lib/db/seed.ts` — Database seeding script
  - `src/lib/research/db.ts` — Research raw SQL queries (tagged template wrapper)
- Added `pg` and `@types/pg` as dependencies
- Created `zavis_landing` PostgreSQL database on EC2 from `neondb-full-dump.sql`
- Applied Drizzle schema via `drizzle-kit generate` + `drizzle-kit migrate`
- Applied research schema from `src/lib/research/schema.sql` (pipeline_runs, linkedin_posts, email_blasts, automation tables, etc.)
- Restored 108 journal articles from dump (`journal_articles` table was dropped for migration, then data re-imported)
- Seeded directory data: 8 cities, 62 areas, 28 categories, 53 subcategories, 38 providers, 88 FAQs

### Deployment Infrastructure
- Set up PM2 with ecosystem config (`ecosystem.config.js`) on port 3200
- Configured Nginx reverse proxy for `zavis.ai`, `www.zavis.ai`, and direct IP access
- Fixed critical Nginx issue: `_next/static` must be served directly from disk (not proxied) because Next.js route groups `(directory)/(research)/(landing)` create chunk paths with parentheses that break when URL-encoded by browsers
- Created GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) for auto-deploy on push to main
- Added GitHub secrets `EC2_HOST` and `EC2_SSH_KEY`
- Created GitHub webhook (ID: 602502216) pointing to `/api/deploy-webhook` with HMAC verification
- Deploy webhook server running on port 9100 via PM2 (`zavis-deploy-webhook`)
- Added `/api/health` endpoint for deploy verification (returns git SHA, commit message, uptime)

### Code Fixes
- Removed unused `subcategories` variable in `src/app/(directory)/directory/[city]/[...segments]/page.tsx` (was causing build failure)
- Added error logging to `getDbArticles()` in `src/lib/intelligence/data.ts` — previously swallowed DB errors silently with empty catch block

### Post-Migration Fixes
- Fixed DB permission issue: tables restored from dump were owned by `postgres`, not `zavis_admin`. Required explicit `GRANT ALL` after migration.
- Fixed `zavis_admin` password authentication failure — password gets reset when other services modify PostgreSQL roles. Must be re-set to `zavis_admin_2026`.
- Both issues caused intelligence page to show "No articles published" despite 108 articles in DB, because `getDbArticles()` caches empty array on first failure.

### Pending
- SSL via certbot (DNS pointed, awaiting certbot run)
- Remove Vercel deployment once EC2 is confirmed stable
- Neon DB project deletion (credentials leaked via GitGuardian alert — `scripts/run-schema.mjs` had hardcoded URI in git history)
